# Privacy Policy – Save Link to Notion

**Last updated:** 2025

## General principles

The **Save Link to Notion** extension is designed to minimise data processing and not collect user information beyond what is necessary for saving to Notion and the optional AI chat feature.

## Data we process

### Stored locally (on your device)

- **Notion API key** and **Notion database ID** – used only to send saved pages to your Notion database.
- **Optional:** AI service API key (e.g. OpenRouter) – used only for the in-extension AI chat feature.
- All of this data is stored in **chrome.storage.local** and **is not sent to the extension developers’ servers**.

### Sent to third-party services (by your browser)

- **Notion (api.notion.com)** – when you save a page, the extension sends to Notion: title, URL, description, tags, and any notes or highlights. Data goes only to your Notion database, which you access with your API key.
- **OpenRouter (openrouter.ai)** – only when you enable and use the AI chat feature; then message content is sent to your chosen AI provider (subject to that provider’s policy).

## What the extension does not do

- **Does not collect** analytics or user statistics.
- **Does not send** any data to the extension developers’ servers.
- **Does not track** browsing behaviour or history beyond actions you take in the extension (e.g. saving a page to Notion).

## Single purpose of the extension

The extension’s main purpose is to let you **save links and notes to your own Notion database** and, optionally, **use an AI assistant** in the context of the page you are viewing. All data is used only for these features.
